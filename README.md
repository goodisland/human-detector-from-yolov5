# human-detector-from-yolov5
"Human Detector from YOLOv5" sends an email when a person is detected from YOLOv5. The content of the email will be the text of the detection result and an attached image, as shown in the Demo. This may be useful, for example, when a fixed-point camera is installed in an off-limits area.
